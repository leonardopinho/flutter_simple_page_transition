# Single Page Transition Package
This package offers page transitions in an easy and quick-to-configure way. The goal is to provide support for using animation curves (such as Curves.easeInOut, Curves.bounceIn, etc.), while also allowing customization of behaviors like slide direction, scale origin, and fade intensity. This enables the creation of smoother and simpler experiences, enhancing usability and adding a modern visual touch to navigation interactions in Flutter.
